Fixed line example calling Canberra from outside Australia: <strong>+61 2</strong> (local eight digit number)
Example calling a mobile from outside Australia:<strong> +61 4</strong> (following eight digits of the mobile number)

# Emergency Calls

Australiaâ€™s primary emergency call service number is Triple Zero: <a href="tel:000">000</a> for police/fire/ambulance services in Australia and can be called from any fixed or mobile phone and certain VoIP services.

<a href="tel:112">112</a>is available from all GSM or GSM derived mobile phones and is automatically translated to the country's emergency number.

It is important to realise that if there is no mobile coverage on any network, you will not be able to reach the emergency call service via a mobile phone, regardless of which number you dialled. [See calling the emergency call service from a mobile phone](http://www.acma.gov.au/theACMA/calling-the-emergency-call-service-from-a-mobile-phone--faqs) - external site for more information.

<a href="tel:106">106</a> is the text-based emergency number for people who are deaf, or who have a hearing or speech impairment. This service operates using a textphone (TTY) or a computer with modem access.

See [Emergency and disaster assistance](https://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/public-safety-and-law/emergency-services/emergency-and-disaster-assistance) for other emergency and disaster phone numbers.

# Free call, toll free and premium rate numbers

Australia uses the free call prefix of <strong>18/1800</strong> for calls from land line telephones. Free calls for mobiles to 18/1800 numbers are being introduced; your mobile telephone company can advise whether this change has been made.

There are also <strong>13/1300</strong> numbers which are charged at the cost similar to a local call. Charges for calls to 13/1300 numbers from landline and mobile phones are different. Calls from mobile phones may incur a higher charge.

Similarly, <strong>190x</strong> is the prefix for premium rate services such as recorded information, competition lines, etc. These types of calls often have very high rates.

These numbers don't work from outside Australia. [See charges for calls to 13/1300 & 18/1800 numbers](http://www.acma.gov.au/Citizen/Phones/Numbers/Special-numbers/charges-for-calls-to-13-1300-and-1800-numbers-i-acma)- external site for more information.
